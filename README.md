# Image effect with CSS text
![](https://github.com/u-n-s-t-o-p-p-a-b-l-e/Tamar/blob/main/img/css-text-effect.png)
<br />

This CSS project includes:
Toggle theme light mode and dark mode with Javascript, HTML and CSS.



`#bash`

```
google-chrome index.html
```

It will run in chrome browser.
Or you can use any other browser such as firefox etc.

<br />


To avoid CORS error, simply use http server.
Install it globally '(-g)' using npm
```
npm install -g http-server
```
<br />

Then run it within your terminal, in your project root folder ( that contain an index.html file ):

```bash
http-server
```
It will give the URL on localhost.<br />
To open the browser automatically, add `-o`. 
<br />
In order to clear the cache for smoother result (debugging purpose), add `-c-1`.

```
http-server -o -c-1
```
<br />
<br />

For live changes, use `live-server` instead. It will auto refresh the browser everytime we save the file for any changes.
<br />
For installation:
```
npm install -g live-server
```
<br />
To run it:
```
live-server
```
